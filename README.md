# CMC ML course

This repository contains practical work done as part of the ML course at my faculty. Each folder has a jupiter notebook using a specific method, as well as a description.pdf file with a description of the task. 

The course involves in-depth mastering of all classical machine learning algorithms and the using of appropriate libraries.
